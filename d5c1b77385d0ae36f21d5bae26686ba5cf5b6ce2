      "message": "Hi Lukas,\n\nWould you please help take a look at this simple CL? To port lang-id, we have forked aosp/libutf in CrOS. Then we found that it can not pass the compilation because some \"unreachable returns\". We have modified it in CrOS here https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/aosp/platform/external/libutf/+/2248286 and we think maybe it is also good to sync it to upstream. \n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\nHonglin",
