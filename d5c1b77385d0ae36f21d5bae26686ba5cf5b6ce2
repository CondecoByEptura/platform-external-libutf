      "message": "Hi Lukas,\n\nWould you please help take a look at this simple CL? To port lang-id, we have forked aosp/libutf in CrOS. Then we found that it can not pass the compilation because some \"unreachable returns\". We have modified it in CrOS here https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/aosp/platform/external/libutf/+/2248286 and we think maybe it is also good to sync it to upstream. \n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\nHonglin",

      "message": "Thanks Honglin for doing that! The upstream is in: googl3/third_party/utf And as this code seems to lack tests, it\u0027d seem better to me for simplicity rather not to touch it unless it has functional implications :) Please let me know if you disagree or think this has some implications other than cosmetic.",
